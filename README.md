site-monitor
============

Cross platform Python script that monitors URL and send notification using Gmail when a keyword appear/disappeared.

How to use
----------
Download the .py fiile and edit it use your favorite text editor. You need to change "Runtime Settings" and "Private Settings" sections. Normally you don't have to touch "Private Settings" after your customization. You may run different instances for this script or change the code to monitor multiple sites. Use Linux's Screen command is a suggestion if you use ssh to login remotely and run multiple monitoring instances.

Since it's a simple script file I just made it short so it runs indefinitely if the criteria is not hit. To stop it you can press Ctrl+C in Windows/Linux. It has a debug mode which will print more information while not sending email notification. For any programmers it's self-explanatory and I hope it could be helpful for you.
